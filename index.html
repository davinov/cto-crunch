            It appeared there was no market circa 1998 for managing online the "gray market" of luxury watches; Yes, these people wanted to exchange inventory between them. We thought we would buy them the comuters and pay for the internet access. We just waited a bit too long to discover   they would never allow for a written trace of their deals.

            And you know .. often in startups everybody does everything more or less. But people who code are a bit different. Because its true that some of the stuff, well you do need to be able to do some coding in order to contribute ..

              <li>And I have been coding for a while. In a bunch of languages. Like Assembly. And Basic. And Pascal. And PHP. But not recently. </li>
              <li>Now, I like Ruby and Python, and GoLang (though its kind of ugly). I really love Elixir.</li>
              <li>Like everybody else I have my periods. And it really depends on the kind of company your are working on.  Sometimes I am the traditionalist, <strong>let's-play-it-safe-and-use-Ruby-on-Rails-with-Postgres</strong> kind of guy. Sometimes I will be the <strong>event-sourcing-with-Haskell-all-the-way</strong> guy. Depends on the project, depends on the team. But we'll talk about this later.</li>

              <li>I am very much interested in machine learning and big data, so I organize #ParisDataGeeks probably the largest active regular user group in Paris with 2,400 members</li>
